# web-dev-projects

I am using this repository to maintain code for some of my Web-Development Projects.

The sites here are of varying levels of complexity, with some being simple HTML pages, and others running extensive frontend and backend code that is also linked to databases.

This variety in technologies used reflects my personal learning arc within the space of web development.
